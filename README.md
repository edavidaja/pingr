# pingr: check if a server is alive

The pingr package has tools to check if a remote computer or web server is
up and some other related tools.

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("pingr")
```

If you need the development version, install it from GitHub:

```r
pak::pak("r-lib/pingr")
```

## ICMP ping

The `ping()` function does ICMP ping, via the system's `ping` utility:


```r
library(pingr)
```

```
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'pingr'
```

```
#> The following object is masked from 'package:utils':
#> 
#>     nsl
```

```r
ping("127.0.0.1")
```

```
#> [1] 0.087 0.301 0.206
```

By default it sends three packets and measures the time it receives and answer.
It waits between sending out the packets, so if you want a really quick check,
you can just send a single packet:


```r
ping("127.0.0.1", count = 1)
```

```
#> [1] 0.182
```

If a machine is down (or it does not exist), then `NA` is returned instead
of the roundtrip time:


```r
ping("192.0.2.1", count = 1)
```

```
#> [1] NA
```

## TCP ping

With TCP ping we can check if a machine is listeing on a TCP port, e.g. if
google's search web server is up and running:


```r
ping_port("www.google.com", port = 80, count = 1)
```

```
#> [1] 19.228
```

## Query the public IP address of the computer

`my_ip()` queries the public IP of the computer, either via DNS or HTTPS:


```r
my_ip()
```

```
#> [1] "83.50.96.133"
```

## Check if the computer is online

`is_online()` checks if the computer is online. It makes three tries:

* Queries myip.opendns.com on OpenDNS, see `my_ip()`.
* Retrieves icanhazip.com via HTTPS, see `my_ip()`.
* Retrieve Apple's Captive Portal test page, see `apple_captive_test()`.

If any of these are successful, it returns `TRUE`.


```r
is_online()
```

```
#> [1] TRUE
```

## DNS queries

The package also contains a function to perform DNS queries. This is a
more portable and more functional version of the `utils::nsl()` function:


```r
nsl("www.r-project.org", type = 1L)
```

```
#> $answer
#>                 name class type  ttl               data
#> 1  www.r-project.org     1    5 6525 cran.wu-wien.ac.at
#> 2 cran.wu-wien.ac.at     1    1  300      137.208.57.37
#> 
#> $flags
#>    aa    tc    rd    ra    ad    cd 
#> FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
nsl("google.com", type = 28L)
```

```
#> $answer
#>         name class type ttl                     data
#> 1 google.com     1   28 210 2a00:1450:4003:80f::200e
#> 
#> $flags
#>    aa    tc    rd    ra    ad    cd 
#> FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```
